# DRX - Critical Strain for the onset of Dynamic Recrystallization
This repository contains the code for generating the two figures of the paper [A short note on approximating the critical strain for the onset of dynamic recrystallization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19551). The paper provides a MATLAB code to determine the critical strain associated with the onset of dynamic recrystallization. The code takes a closed-form constitutive model and derives the critical strain by solving `\frac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial \sigma^2}=0`. Moreover, several models that could be used for this purpose are studied. The results suggest that the most suitable model is the one proposed in the work of [Solhjoo(2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matdes.2013.08.055) for the intended purpose, which is also the only model (in its original form) that can handle initial stress (`\sigma_0`).
